This is an awesome file 1 added directly from GitHub.com
And now i am about to commit directly to GitHub.com remote repository
This is not samething we would do normally
We are just trying simulate a stiation where remote repository history is ahead of local repository history
In plain english remote is additional commit that local does not have
